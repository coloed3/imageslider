                    <p class="text-body">Andy Worshek served as Sonar Chief and Chief of the Boat for the USS Santa

                        with

                        is an expert in

                    <h2>David Horning</h2>
                    <p class="text-body">After those words of “encouragement” delivered by a high school teacher after
                        grading a paper I
                        wrote on wanting to
                        perform comedy for a living, he decided to give up on comedy and go to college for political
                        science. After coasting
                        through school without much passion, I was inspired to move to New York City by a friend who
                        decided that acting in
                        front of hundreds of people every night on a Broadway stage was a realistic goal. My
                        perspective changed: “If he can do
                        that, why can’t I do comedy in packed arenas?”</p>
                    <p class="text-body">In August of 2012, I moved from Akron, Ohio to New York City with the dream of
                        one day being a
                        writer and performer on Saturday Night Live. Enrolling in sketch comedy writing classes at the
                        Upright Citizen’s Brigade (UCB), I went on to write, co-produce, and star in two web series,’
                        wrote and co-starred in a video featured on the front page of humor website Funny or Die, and
                        performed my unique brand of character comedy at clubs around the city. In June of 2014, I was
                        presented with the opportunity to produce a sketch comedy show at Carolines on Broadway.
                        Jumping on the opportunity to be featured at one of the world’s most storied comedy clubs, I
                        created “Laundry Day,” along with some of UCB’s funniest performers, and served as the show’s
                        producer. After only two performances, the show went on to be selected as part of the 2014 New
                        York Comedy Festival in November of that year.

                    <p class="text-body">
                        Our passion is located at the intersection of our interests and talents, it fills a need, and
                        is centered around giving
                        to others. This revelation inspired me to return to the Northeast Ohio area in the fall of
                        2014. As an avid researcher
                        of the practical impact of human behavior, self-development, leadership, management, and
                        positive psychology, I saw an
                        opportunity to use what I had learned to deliver a more meaningful message than just comedy.
                        Seeing a need for
                        perspective in the world, I decided to fuse motivational speaking and comedy together, and I
                        have spoken for
                        businesses, professional organizations, service clubs, college students and faculty, and
                        convention audiences around
                        the country. Being able to inspire laughter, empowerment, and growth inspires me to wake up
                        each morning with one
                        mission in mind: to inspire others to do the same.
